# Welcome to AquaFit Pro (name to be changed maybe)

## Project Overview
**AquaFit Pro** is an integrated booking, learning, and membership platform for a leisure centre (and maybe triathlon training). It allows customers to book structured swim blocks, instructors to track swimmer progression, and management to oversee the business.
